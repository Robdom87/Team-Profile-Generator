# Team-Profile-Generator

## Description 
The Team Profile Generator is a terminal based application that allows the user to create and fill a template html with different team members. 

The program is initialized by "npm run start" in the terminal. The user is then prompted with questions regarding the managers information. Each team has only one manager. 

After the user inputs all the information, they can choose whether to add an engineer, add an intern, or finish the html. 

If add an engineer or add an intern is selected, the user is prompted to answer informational questions regarding their selected team member.

If the user chooses to finish, the html is created within the dist folder.

The generator also comes along with a set of test that validates the functionality of the classes used. The test can be run with 'npm run test'.
